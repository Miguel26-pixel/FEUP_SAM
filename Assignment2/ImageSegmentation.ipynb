    "## Objectives\n",
    "This practical assignment intends to apply and consolidate the knowledge gained concerning image processing techniques to process and improve images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this laboratory assignment is to allow the student to experiment further digital processing techniques of visual signals, using Python and the OpenCV library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct the proposed experiments, we will use Python scripts and images available on the course platform. Images will be used as input data to those scripts. The output will consist of processed versions of those images, which should be analyzed by the student to interpret the effects of the conducted processing operations. The majority of those images has the bitmap format (.bmp) which means that each pixel is represented by three RGB eight-bit values, so in total 24 bits per pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the symbol ‚úç means that you should include in your report graphics or images resulting from the operated processing or code that you may have developed. The symbol üïµ indicates that you should include in your report a brief analysis of the results you have obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "1. We will use the OpenCV library for the image processing tasks. To install the OpenCV library, you can use the following bash command (inside the SAM conda environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install opencv-python\n",

One possibility for doing this is to inspect the values of the B matrix: high values will correspond to the background. If we set up a threshold with a value just below those higher values, all the pixels that have a value lower than the threshold in principle will belong to the foreground (they will represent the foreground objects, i.e., the jumping man, the christmas bulbs or the bird). Using that threshold, copy from the B matrix to a new matrix (with the same dimensions) only the pixel values that are below that threshold. When doing that you may put those pixels with the value 255 and all the others with value 0 (you will create a black and white picture). To decide on the threshold, instead of looking directly at the values of the B matrix, you may generate the histogram with the built-in function `cv2.calcHist` (or other that you may prefer) and by inspecting visually the histogram decide on a suitable threshold value (the script may ask the user to input that value).\n",
